Combination of Genetic Algorithms and Optimized Deterministic Algorithms for Exact Cover Problems.

To run the program, if you want to provide an input configuration from a CSV file, copy it into the same directory as the .py file and modify line 607 by replacing 'easy1.csv' with the name of the input file.

Alternatively, it is possible to define a NumPy array corresponding to the input Sudoku and pass it to the brka_algorithm method (line 624).

Examples of how to define the initial Sudoku are provided in the files "easy1.csv", "hard10.csv", and "extreme1.csv" available in this directory.
